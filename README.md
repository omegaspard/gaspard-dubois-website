# gaspard dubois website

My website made with the play framework.

# Motivations   

In our current era we have many options to display our professional profile with much more visibility than our own website.

That said, I still thought it was interesting to build my personal website.

Web development isn't my biggest interest in the IT field, but it still represents a huge part of the IT market and working on this
project will allow me to stay in touch with it.

Since the only things I paid from the hosting service are the domain name and a VPS machine it gave me a concrete experience interecting with network such as DNS management, IP configurations, SSL certificate...

Get in touch with the search engine optimization could be interesting as well.

If you already took a look at the website, you may have noticed that the design and its behaviour is very simple, and that's what I like.
Web engineering is known to be overflowed with frameworks and libraries that I didn't feel like using  the few I wanted to realise here.

Even though this application is very simple, I'm currently using the scala Play framework because I'm interested in Scala and I like the JVM environment it provide.

The rest the application is pure HTML/CSS and Javascript. I might add more external tools the more I advance in this project.


# TODO list

Here a list of the elements that are crossing my mind:
- Add a real CI/CD workflow so I don't have to manually deploy the app (it's only a sh file currently).
- I have another [Snake Game project](https://github.com/omegaspard/simple-snake-in-java) coded in Java (only in terminal currently), embedding the game on the website could be interesting one I had a real gaming interface to the project.
- Add a French version of the website. (Done)
- Add more dynamic front end element? Animation when loading the website, the behaviours when hovering some elements, pictures?
- Add test.
- Add https.
