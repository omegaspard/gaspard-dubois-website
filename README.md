# gaspard dubois website

My website made with the play framework.

# Motivations   

Why this website does exist ?
In our current era we have many options to display our professional profile with much more visibility than our own website.
That said, I still thought it was interesting to build my personal website well... just because.

Web development isn't my biggest interest in the IT field, but it still represents a huge part of the IT market and working on this
project will allow me to stay in touch with it.

If you already took a look at the website, you may have noticed that the design and its behaviour is very simple, and that's what I like.
Web engineering is known to be overflowed with frameworks and libraries that I didn't feel using  the few I wanted to realise here.

I'm currently using the scale Play framework I'm interested in Scala and I like the JVM environment it provide.The rest the application is pure HTML/CSS and Javascript. I might add more external tools the more I advance in this project.


# TODO list

Here a list of the elements that are crossing my mind:
- Add a CI/CD workflow so I don't have to manually deploy the app.
- I have another Snake Game project coded in Java, embedding the project on the website could be interesting.
- Add a French version of the website.
- Add more dynamic front end element? Animation when loading the website, the reaction when hovering some element, pictures?
